You can deploy a serverless scheduling Streamlit app using Azure Functions 
To achieve the desired functionality and minimize costs. Here's a high-level overview of the approach:

Develop your Streamlit app: Create a Streamlit application that allows clients to input their schedules. 
Streamlit is a Python library for building interactive web applications. 
You can use Streamlit to create forms or UI components for capturing schedule inputs from clients.

Azure Functions setup: Set up an Azure Functions app in your Azure account. Azure Functions supports Python as a runtime, so you can write your functions using Python.

Function for schedule submission: Create an Azure Function that triggers when a client submits their schedule. 
This function will receive the schedule input, process it, and store it in a database or any other suitable storage option provided by Azure, such as Azure Blob Storage or Azure Cosmos DB.

Scheduler function: Create another Azure Function that runs periodically to update the scheduler based on the submitted schedules. 
This function can fetch the schedules from the storage, perform any necessary calculations or updates, and store the updated scheduler information.

Secure authentication: Implement authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized clients can access the scheduling app. 
Azure provides services like Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) that you can integrate with your app for user authentication and management.

Deploy and configure: Deploy your Streamlit app and Azure Functions to Azure. 
You can use deployment tools like Azure CLI or Azure DevOps for streamlined deployment. 
Configure the necessary environment variables, connections to databases, and authentication settings.

Share the URL with clients: Once your app is deployed and running, you can share the URL with your clients. 
They can access the app, input their schedules, and view the scheduler updates based on their inputs.
